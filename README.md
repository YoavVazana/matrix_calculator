Project description: Matrix calculator
As part of my programming studies, I developed a matrix calculator program in C. This small-scale project aims to implement basic matrix operations and demonstrate proficiency in programming logic and algorithms.

Main features:
Matrix Operations:
 The calculator supports basic matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and scalar multiplication.
Matrix Inversion:
 It includes functionality to calculate the inverse of a square matrix.
Error Handling:
 Robust error handling ensures that the program handles illegal inputs and operations gracefully, and provides informative error messages when needed.
